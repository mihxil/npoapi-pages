= Rendering a site via the pages api

The NPO pages api is actually meant to facility _searching_ in your site.

The objects it contains are quite complete though. This is a simple demo on how it could be used to
actually serve a site via it.

It is implemented with python flask.

== Running

The link:Makefile[makefile] documents how to run it.

The app can be configured with the following environment variables:

- secret: The NPO api secret
- apiKey: The NPO  apiKey. This defaults to ione7ahfij (vpro)
- origin: The NPO origin. this default to https://www.vpro.nl
- profile: The profile to base the site on.
- configdir: Set this to the cwd to get mentioned defaults working

Set up link:https://github.com/npo-poms/pyapi[pyapi], with flask (`pip install flask`) and run

[source, bash]
----
export secret=<see 1password or so>
configdir=$(pwd) profile=vpro flask run
----

I prepared a docker image with required dependencies too:

[source, bash]
----
docker run --env secret=${secret} --env profile=vpro -p 5000:5000  mihxil/npoapi-pages
----
